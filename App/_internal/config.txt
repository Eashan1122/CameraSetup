Description:
    This is a normal configaration file with only an option to choose which camera you want to use.
    The way to recognize this is that if you have an inbuilt camera then it will be taken as 0 and the rest would be marked as 1-2-3...n.
    If you don't have any inbuilt camera then the attached camera will only be marked as 0 then 1-2-3...n.
